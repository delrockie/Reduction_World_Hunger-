We believe that no one should face hunger when perfectly good food goes to waste. Our mobile-based platform connects surplus food with those in need.

No one should go hungry while food is wasted.

For example,40% of food in Kenya goes to waste while 2 in 8 Kenyan families struggle with hunger.

I've dcided to develop a mobile-based platform to redistribute surplus food to individuals and families facing hunger.

THE PLATFORM WILL ENABLE THE FOLLOWING:

Posting Surplus Food

Restaurants and grocery stores post surplus food on our app.

Claiming and Pickup

Users claim and pick up the surplus food.

Impacting Lives

Food redistribution reduces waste and hunger, promoting sustainability.

We invite you to join us in reducing food waste, addressing hunger, and creating a sustainable future for all.

The US,for example, experiences $218 billion in food waste annually, presenting an immense market opportunity for our platform.
